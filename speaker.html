					<h6><b>Title:</b><i>An Exploration of Geospatial Data</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> 
In this talk I will present, from the perspective of problem, our recent work on cleaning, searching, visualizing various forms of geospatial data, such as point of interest data, area of interest data and trajectory data. From the perspective of methodology, I will present indexing techniques, pruning paradigms, and theoretical analysis of algorithms. At the end of the talk several system prototypes of geospatial data exploration will be demonstrated to the audience.

						<p align="justify"><b>Bio: </b> Renata Borovica-Gajic holds a position of Lecturer in Data Analytics in the School of Computing and Information Systems at The University of Melbourne. Dr Borovica-Gajic received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland in 2016. Renata's research focuses on solving data management problems when storing, accessing and processing massive data sets, enabling faster, more predictable, and cheaper data analysis as a result. She envisions database systems as dynamic entities able to adjust query processing strategies to fit the characteristics of data and usage patterns. She is also interested in the topics of scientific data management, data exploration, query optimization, physical database design, and hardware-software co-design. Her work has appeared in the premier data management conferences such as SIGMOD, VLDB, and ICDE.</p>

					<h6><b>Title:</b><i>A tale of learning databases</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The ability to perform timely, predictable and cost-effective analytical processing of large data sets to extract deep insights is a key ingredient to the success of many industrial and government domains (e.g., internet search, marketing firms, telecommunications, and healthcare). Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are, however, not the first choice for servicing these modern applications, due to long preparation steps required to set up the DBMS for analysis.

In this talk, I am going to show that the game is not lost for traditional DBMSs. I will demonstrate that traditional DBMSs can still provide timely, predictable, and cost-effective analytics and join the race of servicing modern applications, if they embrace an adaptive and agile approach in which the query processing strategy is learned on the go and adjusted during query processing to fit the characteristics of: i) the user query requests (workload), ii) the data, and iii) the underlying hardware. In particular, workload-driven learning is introduced as a means of enabling efficient data exploration and reducing the time to first insight. Data-driven learning alleviates suboptimal query processing strategies by automatically transforming the access strategy during query processing to fit the observed characteristics of the data. Finally, hardware-driven learning is an example of the adaptation of the DBMS engine to the properties of new hardware technology (cold storage) as a cost-effective solution for storing the ever-increasing customer data base.</p>

He received his PhD degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2014, and received his bachelor and master degrees in computer science and technology from Zhejiang University in 2006 and 2008, respectively. Prior to studying at NTU, he worked as a scientific assistant in the Center for Data-Intensive Systems (Daisy) in Aalborg University (AAU) for two years. His research interests include data management (in particular on spatial, temporal, textual, and graph data), databases, and data mining. Most of his work was published in premier database conferences and journals, such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, VLDBJ, and TODS.

					<h6><b>Title:</b><i>Group Search in Location-Aware Social Networks</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The online social networks have greatly changed the way that people interact with each other and also with the world. With the proliferation of wireless communication techniques and GPS-equipped mobile devices (e.g., smart phones), nowadays people are able to access the social networks almost anywhere at anytime. The location information plays an important role in social network applications, because the geographical information brings social networks from virtual to reality, bridging the gap between the physical world and online social networking services. We will discuss how to efficiently search a group of objects (e.g., a community, a region, and a route etc) in such location-aware social networks.

					<h6><b>Title:</b><i>Scalable Exploration of Data-Driven Insights</i></h6>
					<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Data Exploration is a key ingredient in a diverse set of discovery-oriented applications, in which data analysts explore large volumes of data looking for valuable insights. Hence, automated data exploration solutions have emerged to effectively guide users through that challenging process. To that end, this talk will present sophisticated query processing and optimization techniques that are particularly suited to match data exploration tasks leading to quick, diverse, and valuable insights. In particular, different aspects of the data exploration life cycle will be discussed, including: visual analytics, data summarization and diversification, query refinement and recommendation, and scalable interactive query formulation. Additionally, we will investigate new challenges and future research directions in the area of data exploration.
